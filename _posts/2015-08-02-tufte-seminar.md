Edward [Tufte][] gave his one-day class here in Denver on Friday and I was fortunate
enough to attend.   It was a day well spent.   I expected a lot of high-flown
graphics talk that would be hard to fit into my daily routine.  Instead the
focus was surprisingly practical and relevant.  It's going to
make a difference in my life.   Specifically, my presentations are going to
change.   The bullet points are not going away entirely but maybe there will be
fewer of them.   Here is what I learned.
