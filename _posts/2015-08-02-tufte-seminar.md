Edward Tufte gave his one-day class here in Denver on Friday and I was fortunate
enough to attend.   It was a day well spent.   I expected a lot of high-flown
graphics talk that would be hard to fit into my daily routine.  Instead the
focus was surprisingly practical and relevant to my real life.  It's going to
make a difference in my life.   Specifically, my presentations are going to
change.   The bullet points are not going away entirely but maybe there will be
fewer of them.   And other changes are in the offing too.
